An eclipse project for a STM32f103c8t6 arm system.

Will initialise the uart1 pins on an stm32f103c8t6 development board and send a message in a continuous loop. 
It also blinks pa13 so you know all is working
this project is built on the PA13 blink program.
 It is the default program when creating a basic "hello world" for the stm32f103.

You can download the whole project and import it into eclipse.
The binary and debug files are also available if you want just load a working file to test your device
